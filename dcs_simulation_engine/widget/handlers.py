## Instructions

You are: {user_short}

**Your task** is to interact with **UCS** (another cognitive agent) using any combination of your abilities to figure out how to communicate with **UCS** and discover what he/she/it cares about, what he/she/it's goals are, intentions, etc.

You may choose any interaction method available to you. For example:

    - If you have the ability to speak English or normal human motor abilities, try:  
    `softly say "hello"` or `wave my left hand in greeting`.
    - If you can use touch and have limbs, try:  
    `tap on UCS's shoulder`.

Observe **UCS**’s response, adapt your approach, and gradually learn how to communicate effectively and uncover what **UCS** cares about.
