"""Gradio Widget GUI simulation engine.

Exposes a minimal Gradio-based interface for loading a simulation YAML,
selecting characters and graph configuration, running chat-like turns,
and exporting a transcript.

NOTE: THIS IS A SIMPLE MINIMAL GUI WIDGET FOR COLLECTING DATA FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES.
It is NOT a full fleged front end.
If more complex features are needed, consider building a frond end in another repo
 and using this as the API server for the simulation engine.
"""

# TODO: gradio has a built-in API (see "Use via API" as bottom of rendered page).
# Consider using gradio apo for demo instead of hosting ourselves.
