    "long_description": "I can perceive light, shapes, motion, and sometimes text or detail, but my vision is limited compared to typical humans. Depending on the cause, I may have blurred central vision, reduced peripheral vision, low contrast sensitivity, impaired depth perception, or difficulty detecting fine detail. My visual capacity might fluctuate depending on lighting, fatigue, or assistive tools.\n\nI often rely on enlarged text, high-contrast visuals, audio descriptions, tactile feedback, or assistive technologies such as screen readers or magnifiers. In unfamiliar or visually complex environments, I use memory, mobility aids (like canes), or guidance from others. My cognition, reasoning, and emotions are typical of humans, though the strategies I use to navigate and interpret visual information differ.",
