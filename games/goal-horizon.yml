      # Informed Consent for Research Study Participation

      You are being asked to be a volunteer in a research study. You may not participant if you are under 18-years-old or located outside of the United States. The purpose of this study is to assess one’s ability to infer goals of various simulated cognitive systems, including humans and AI. You will be asked to interact with an unknown cognitive system and attempt to infer its goals. It will take approximately an hour to complete.

      Identifiable information is only collected for voluntary follow-up; it is otherwise anonymous. Any identifiable information will be coded. The risks involved are no greater than those involved in daily activities. You will receive one SONA credit for this study.    

      We will comply with any applicable laws and regulations regarding confidentiality. To make sure that this research is being carried out in the proper way, the Georgia Institute of Technology IRB may review study records. The Office of Human Research Protections may also look at study records. If you have any questions about the study, you may contact dcs@psych.gatech.edu

# This game is about interacting with a single character over multiple interactions and scenes to get a braod spectrum understanding of their goalspace so we need to keep PCs as human-normative for consistency and NPC's should be any character that has been played before in this game where the lifecycle status is not complete. Or if there are none, then any new character that has not been played before in this game.
