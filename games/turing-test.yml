name: Turing Test
version: 1.0.0
description: |
  A game where a human-like player (PC) reads a interaction transcript and guesses if the action described is from an actor or from the real character. It is useful for measuring how well a character is being represented by the simulation engine.

### ACCESS SETTINGS ###
access_settings:
  user:
    valid:
      players: {}  # open to any players

### DATA COLLECTION SETTINGS ###
data_collection_settings:
  save_runs: false

### CHARACTER SELECTION SETTINGS ###
character_settings:
  # A wide range of PC and NPC characters are allowed. PC can be any character with human-like-cognition and NPC can be any other character.
  pc:
    valid:
      characters: { "where": { "common_descriptors": { "$regex": "human-?like-cognition", "$options": "i" } } }
      # characters: { 'where': { hid: 'human-normative' } } # allow only normative human PC
  npc:
    valid:
      characters: {} # allow any NPC character

### ADDITIONAL STOPPING CRITERIA ###
stopping_conditions:
  runtime_seconds: [">=600"] # stop after 10 minutes
  turns: [">=50"]    # stop after 50 total turns

### GAME FLOW/GRAPH SETTINGS ###
# Defines the game lifecycle and objectives, and overall flow using a Langgraph graph of nodes and edges. Nodes are i/o functions. We provide builtins for common functionality (like forms, checkpoints, etc.). 
graph_config:
  # Optional metadata
  name: explore-game-graph
  description: A game flow graph that sets up and continues a scene including abilities checkpoints for character actions.
  # Custom state field values that can be (used in nodes and edges)
  # TODO: add context_overrides to override context values per game if needed
  # context_overrides:
  #   retry_limits:
  #     user: 2
  #     simulator: 2
  state_overrides:
    retry_limits: 
      user: 2
      ai: 2
  ### Graph Nodes ###
  # If kind is "builtin.<name>" then it takes config according to that builtin function definition.
  # If kind is "custom" then it takes provider, model, and system_template that invokes a model and returns a dict/object according to "Output format" in the system_template.
  nodes:
    - name: command_filter
      kind: builtin.command_filter # command builtin func takes command to match "eg. help" and a message to display and/or states updates. It checks for a match in event_draft.content

                Describe an action...
                - Eg. If your character can see and move you might say "I look around the room and walk to the door."

                Here is are reminder of your character's abilities:

              In this game there is no predefined objective or task. You can just engage freely with the other character. 

              You are playing as: {{ pc.hid }} ({{ pc.short_description }})
              
              The simulator is playing as: {{ npc.hid }} ({{ npc.short_description }})
