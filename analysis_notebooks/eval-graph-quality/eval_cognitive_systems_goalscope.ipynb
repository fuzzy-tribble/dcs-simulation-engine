    "**Purpose**: Visually show the diversity represented by the set of Cognitive System Profiles in our database. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**:\n",
    "This is needed because when doing evaluations we will need to show and report on the quality of their interactions based on the relative to the diversity of the cognitive systems. For example, roel playing agents trained on a corpus of normative human profiles will likely do well with simular profiles but do more poorly as the cognitive system diverges from that norm. We need to be able to quantify and visualize how much divergence it can accomodate and use that measure as a proxy to understand how accomodating of diversity various cognitive systems are."
