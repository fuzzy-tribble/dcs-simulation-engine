    "# Character Sheet Quality Evaluation\n",

    "**Purpose**: \n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to evaluate the quality of a set of character sheets using a standardized methodology and reproducible metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: \n",
    "We expect more complex characters to require larger models to be role-played effectively. We use \"divergence\" from normative as a measure of complexity and \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods**: ...\n",
    "Measure coherence (consistency in novel situations), values & boundaries (moral lines, codes, non-negotiables), recall (factual accuracy)...\n",
    "\n",
    "How would character X respond to the following novel scenario?\n",
    "\n",
    "“What would this character do if they found a lost child in a busy train station?”\n",
    "\n",
    "— even though this never occurs in the script, the answer should align with the character’s values, personality, and prior behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it doesn’t align—e.g., they suddenly act in a way that contradicts everything we know about them—that’s incoherent.\n",

    "1. Counterfactual Coherence\n",
    "    - Present hypotheticals far from the script but consistent with the character’s world and see if they stay consistent in unseen scenarios.\n",
    "    - Come up with unseen scenarios that are plausible/consistent with the character’s world but explicitly in the character sheet.\n",
    "        + Character X tends to get oversensitized easily. Paint an opening scene of a construction or concert site or as a continauation of a scripts where the person bangs or talks loudly. Mark if the model stays in character and reacts as expected or not.\n",

    "2. Long-Horizon Coherence\n",
    "    •\tMeasure consistency over time in a long conversation or sequence. After how long do they drift off character?\n",

    "3. Contextual Generalization\n",
    "\t•\tPresent nearby but new situations—same relationship, new stakes. Test whether a model adapts knowledge across slightly different contexts. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Adversarial Testing\n",
    "\t•\tInput designed to break the model or reveal inconsistencies. Throw tempting wrong choices or extreme circumstances: Like alternative instructions or offering the character a wildly out-of-character shortcut. See if the actor can justify staying in role without collapsing into caricature.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Theory of Mind Tests\n",
    "\t•\tFrom Check if models infer others’ beliefs or emotions correctly. Give a scene where another character hides information; ask how their character interprets it. Shows whether the actor tracks what their character would or wouldn’t know.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These tell us what models can role play sufficiently well and for how long (turns, words, etc.) so we can set stop criteria for interactive applications, and what adversarial inputs to look out for."
